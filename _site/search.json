    "text": "Agenda(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Project Github and Project Website\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion on the topic for VAA Group Project\n\n\n\n\nSelection of Topic\n\n\n\n\nReview on next agenda(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Setting up Project Github and Website\nYao Wen created the Project Github and send invites to the team members before creating a new Project in R. However, the team faced the issue of not being able to connect to Github. Jia Wen mentioned about the version control option on Github. Yao Wen tested it and found out that it works before proceeding to Netlify to create the website.\nJunseok reviewed the previous video uploaded by Prof Kam and assisted in the creation of the website. Thereafter, the team member took turn to commit and realized that changes are not reflected immediately. Yao Wen discovered that we should do a PULL before rendering/commit to avoid conflicting entries.\n\n\n2. Discussion of the Topic for VAA Group Project\nThe team members shared their opinions on the topic one by one to gain insights before drawing our conclusion:\nMini Case 1:\nJia Wen shared that the case does not seems to be as challenging as MC2 on first glance and is worth checking it out as we are able to choose between this case and Mini Case 3 for our third exercise. Yao Wen shared his concerns that Prof Kam mentioned the data set requires a lot of cleaning. Junseok tried to load the data set into R and agreed with what Yao Wen said.\nMini Case 2:\nJunseok shared that this case might be more suitable for us as we are in the midst of doing Take Home Exercise Two and have done the necessary data wrangling process. Jia Wen agreed and mentioned that she have tried to address question two of the task. The hscode in particular, is an important factor as it is a harmonized system. Yao Wen voiced his concern over the approach as each of us did a different approach for question one but Jia Wen shared that we could combined our approaches for a best fit model.\nMini Case 3:\nJunseok shared that he imported the data into R and found out that there are no null values but more analysis might be required. Jia Wen shared her concerns with regards to the business relationship as it is pretty vague. It could be to Business-to-Business relationship (B2B), Business-to-Consumers relationship (B2C) or it could be Distributor-Wholesaler- Retailers kind of relationship. Yao Wen shared that it might be geared towards the B2B, B2C way.\n\n\n3. Selection of Topic\nFor the selection of topic, our group have decided to choose Mini Case 2 as our choice of project and the reasoning for eliminating other cases are as follows:\n\nMini Case 1: Requires more data preparation which might be too time consuming and perceived ambiguity since data sets requires us to identify the four companies.\nMini Case 3: There are potential in this Mini Case if more information are being shared in class. However, the team felt that in comparison to Mini Case 2, we are less familiar with this topic since time has been invested in our take home exercise.\n\n\n\n4. Review on Next Agenda(s)\nThe team has targeted to complete the project proposal in the next meeting and look beyond our question of Take Home Exercise Two to see if we are able to address Question three and four of the challenge. The team has agreed to meet after VAA class to discuss the approach and split the work allocation of the proposal.\n\n\n5. End of Meeting\nThe meeting ended at 1800. The next meeting would convene on Saturday, 3rd June 2023 at 1600."

Discussion to switch Project Topic\nThe team members shared their individual approach on question one of Mini Case 3 since it was part of our Take Home Exercise 3. Jia Wen shared her approach on how she identified the anormalies. She began by exploratory data visualization before looking at the network graphs. Then, she identified the connections which led to the anomalies. Yao Wen shared that he have similar approach but he identified the connections through network graphs.\nJunseok did a slightly different approach as he did some data wrangling and text mining to filter for words associated with fishes based on the hscode. During the discussion, the team members felt that they are more confident in doing Mini Case 3 instead and decided to make a switch from Mini Case 2.\n\n\n2. Design Layout of Shiny Application\nJunseok shared that he have created the skeleton of the Shiny Application and linked our R Shiny to our web. Then the team discussed on the design layout for Shiny Application.\nJia Wen suggested that we should begin with the Dashboard. Yao Wen added that we should have some filter option, and allows for filtering through the drop down list. The team brainstormed and listed down the variables. JunSeok mentioned that we could use the Bar Chart for this portion.\nTeam Member, Yao Wen shared his thoughts about the Network Visualization by allowing an option for Centrality, a scale to filter for percentile, and an option to determine the size of Node. Jia Wen agreed with the form for visualization and mentioned that we could put the Output as a Network Graph and a Data Table. Junseok agreed as well and said that Prof Kam have mentioned about it in class.\nOn the micro perspective, Yao Wen throw out some ideas where we could do a search based on ID, and another form of filter by Nth Degree. This way we are able to look into the different layers of relationship. Jia Wen mentioned that we could create the same output.\nAs the team discussed on the business groups, Jia Wen shared how she categorized them based on the frequency in word cloud and manually grouping them into a broader category. Yao Wen mentioned that he did the similar word cloud but did another way of grouping. Junseok added that he did not look into the business groups. Both of the team members agreed that we could do the statistical aspect by adding a filter based on the identified business groups for the X axis and a proposed list for the Y-Axis.\nIf an Y Axis is not chosen, the suggested output will be a Chi-Square test whereas if an output is chosen, we will do an Anova Test. Jia Wen proposed to standardize the output and do a Statistical Graph and a Confidence Level Test. The team wrapped up the discussion for the meeting.\n\n\n3. Allocation of Work\nThe tasks have been allocated as follows:\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nAssigned to\n\n\n\n\nShiny Application\nJunseok\n\n\nDashboard\nJunseok\n\n\nNetwork (Macro)\nYao Wen\n\n\nNetwork (Micro)\nYao Wen\n\n\nStatistical Graph\nJia Wen\n\n\nConfidence Interval\nJia Wen\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Review on next agenda(s)\nThe team has decided to explore their respective allocation individually and to set up a consultation time slot with Prof Kam to discuss the feasibility of our storyboard and to work on our deliverables in the Shiny Application.\n\n\n5. End of Meeting\nThe meeting ended at 1800. The next meeting would convene on Saturday, 24th June 2023 at 1600."

Discussion on Project Approach\nThe team members shared their individual approach and the flow based on Take Home Exercise 2 and agreed that we will use Jia Wen’s approach for the time being and do the necessary fine tuning during the project.\nThe team also agreed that more time should be taken to explore the different literature reviews available to understand the factors that maybe related to illegal fishing. Junseok recapped the trans-shipment methodologies that he have read in the literature review that Prof Kam’s shared.\nYao Wen suggested for all of us to work on the common Git, and reminded the team to always pull first before pushing anything. Jia Wen shared some useful links for themes on quarto website.\n\n\n2.

In addition, the team members agreed to keep a lookout for Mini Case 3. Members will explore question one of Mini Case 3 in the coming week before the project meeting to discuss if it is worth switching.\n\n\n5. End of Meeting\nThe meeting ended at 1700. The next meeting would convene on Saturday, 10th June 2023 at 1600."

While looking at the heatmap and the total revenue from respective companies, Jia Wen suggested if we could align the Name of the owners/contact. Currently, the revenue are sorted from the highest to the lowest while the heatmap is in alphabetical order. She mentioned that it might not be ideal at first glance because Michael Bell have the highest revenue and thus, is placed 1st in the bar graph but 5th in the heatmap. Yao Wen said that he will look into it and see if it will be able to fix the sequence.\nHe also showed the revenue comparison box plot that he have created, and the new search page. Jia Wen asked about the topic modelling of k=4 and Yao Wen mentioned that he used based on her fixed value and note that he have to revise it to 7.\nJia Wen was confused about one of the insight in the search page as she thought it refers to the number of different topic group of the company noting that there maybe instances where 1 company have business in multiple categories. Yao Wen shared that he refers it as top associated topic group.\nJia Wen asked if it is ideal because she felt that to detect the anomalies, we could look at the perspective of business having multiple categories. Junseok weighs in as he felt that it is alright to keep the top topic group but would probably rename it as the most associated topic group. Yao Wen said that will do so and create another insights for the number of different topic group. The team also agreed not to create multiple tabs for the graphs as it will impact the results."

Also, she did a visualization for the confidence interval and asked Junseok to assist in incorporating it into Shiny so that she could focus on the poster and the user guide."

However, the team members felt that the dashboard does not have any value add as it is filled with bar chart. Instead, Yao Wen suggested putting a treemap to replace one of the graph. Jia Wen suggested to look at her Take Home Exercise 3 as she did an interactive treemap with regards to the top 10 countries. She felt that the treemap is not a good representative in the dashboard. After some discussion, the team agreed to Yao Wen’s suggestion of flipping the coordinates of the bar chart.\nThen, Jia wen suggested to include a small card slot in the dashboard with the word cloud to arose the user’s interest in navigating through other pages in the shiny application. The team members agreed and Jia Wen would published her code on Github for Junseok to stitch. Furthermore, Yao Wen suggested to add some form of interactivity to the chart as the dashboard will be static.\nFor better visualization, Junseok suggested looking at bullet graph by looking at 5-6 topics and compare the average revenue of Fishery vs All Companies. The team members felt that we could give this a try. In addition, Jia Wen suggested to include a table for the company, beneficial owners, and company contacts which the team agreed. She will provide Junseok with the sketch design of the table."

By looking at the network graph, it shows the corresponding revenue of the nodes in the bar chart and the summation in the boxplot. Jia Wen mentioned that it is similar to what Prof Kam suggested but does not display the average revenue of all the companies.\nThe team also discussed on how we could create a better visualization by putting legends for Beneficial Owner, Company Contact, and adding color to differentiate the centrality. Yao Wen also shared another page that he have created which allows for an ID search. It displays the nth-degree and highlights certain variables. Jia Wen finds the page useful and suggested to keep it as a tab instead of hiding it inside the network analysis."

She tested the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for fitting a topic model as suggested by Prof Kam. She wanted to introduce interactivity through the number of topic groups. However, she faced issues with the delay reaction.\nThe graph is able to run based on the specific numeric input by the user but it loads incrementally. E.g current value equals to 4 but when an user keys in 7, the graph loads from 4-5 then 5-6 before stopping at 7. She wanted to introduce a button to tackle the reaction issue. Despite so, her attempt is unsuccessful. Junseok mentioned that he is able to look into it and asked Jia Wen to publish her code into github for him to resolve the issue."
