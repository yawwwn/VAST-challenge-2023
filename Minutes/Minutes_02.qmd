# 1. Discussion on Project Approach

The team members shared their individual approach based on Take Home Exercise 2 and agreed that we will
use Jia Wen's approach for the time being and do the necessary fine tuning during the project.

The team also agreed that more time should be taken to explore the different literature reviews available
to understand the factors that maybe related to illegal fishing. Junseok recapped the trans-shipment
methodologies that he have read in the literature review that Prof Kam's shared.

# 2. Work Allocation on Project Proposal

JW suggested we open a Telegram group instead of Whatsapp for easier communications.  

YW suggested for all of us to work on the Common Git, and reminded the team to always pull first before
push anything

JW shared useful links for themes: https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites
