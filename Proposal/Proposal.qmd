# 1. Background

In this project, our team will attempt the [VAST Challenge 2023](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/) and build a web-enabled visual analytics application by using R Shiny. The challenge focuses on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is said to be a major contributor to overfishing globally. The illegal fishing trade has been linked to organized crime, and human rights violations are common when fishing operations are conducted without regulatory oversight. FishEye International is a nonpartisan organization whom spent the past years collecting data and have gain access to an international finance corporation's database on fishing related companies. FishEye is enlisting the help of the Visual Analytics community to assist in analysing the data and making recommendations.

# 2. Project Topic

Our group has chosen to take on [Mini-Challenge 3: Identify Anomalous Companies](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/MC3.html). In this challenge, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing (or other "fishy" business). Using visual analytics, our team strives to help identify anomalies that could indicate a company is involved in IUU.

# 3. Motivation

The motivation of our group on the mini-case challenge 3 is as such:

1.  Our group will be providing insights on the relationships between the business groups. Organizations will have a **better understanding of business relationship patterns.**

2.  From the list of product and services that FishEye has provided, we will develop a process to **identify** **the various business group.**

3.  Our attempt from #2 will not only reveal the **business categories**, but also **measure their similarity and express confidence in the groupings**.

4.  Lastly, we will be shedding lights on the potentially suspicious companies. Here, we attempt to make use of techniques for determining companies who are involved in illegal activity within the network, so that FishEye can further investigate the business groups.

# 4. Approach

The following are the approaches by our team to address the different questions.

## 4.1 Overview Summary of Company Data

In this section, we'll explore some exploratory analysis to draw some broad insights on the company data, including but not excluding, median revenue of companies, number of companies per country, wordcloud of words identified in products/services, etc.

These should provide us with a preliminary understanding of the dataset, in order to explore further with graph analysis.

## 4.2 Network Graph to explore relationships and identify anomalies between owners, contacts and companies

In this section, we'll divide the it into 2 panels: 1 exploring Owners & Contacts; 1 exploring Companies.

For both, we'll do a network graph of the owners (including their relationships with the companies). Considering the dataset is huge, we'll do a filter by centrality measures (i.e. betweenness centrality and degree centrality) so users can further filter the dataset to see top N owners & contacts.

In addition, considering community detection would be valuable in this analysis, we'll color the network by the community after running the community detection algorithm.

Next, for the filtered top N owners, we'll do additional barplots and boxplots to highlight their revenue, companies involved in and etc.

## 4.3 Topic Modelling to identify topics based on companies' products & services

Below is an illustration of our approach for topic modelling:\

## 4.4 Nth Degree of relationship

Lastly, in order to facilitate investigation particular owner or particular company that might be suspicious, we will add a section that allows users to search an individual owner or company. By doing so, there would be a network graph that shows the edges and relationships that are related to the node selected.

In addition, user can also specify the Nth degree of relationships. That is, by selection N=2, the network graph will expand to include edges and other nodes related to those are connected to the chosen node.

On top of it, we'll add some value boxes at the top to highlight key insights of the network, such as topics involved, total revenue associated with, etc.
