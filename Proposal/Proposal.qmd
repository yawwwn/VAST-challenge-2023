# 1. Background

In this project, our team will attempt the [VAST Challenge 2023](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/) and build a web-enabled visual analytics application by using R Shiny. The challenge focuses on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is said to be a major contributor to overfishing globally. The illegal fishing trade has been linked to organized crime, and human rights violations are common when fishing operations are conducted without regulatory oversight. FishEye International is a nonpartisan organization whom spent the past years collecting data and have gain access to an international finance corporation's database on fishing related companies. FishEye is enlisting the help of the Visual Analytics community to assist in analysing the data and making recommendations.

# 2. Project Topic

Our group has chosen to take on [Mini-Challenge 3: Identify Anomalous Companies](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/MC3.html). In this challenge, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing (or other "fishy" business). Using visual analytics, our team strives to help identify anomalies that could indicate a company is involved in IUU.

# 3. Motivation

The motivation of our group on the mini-case challenge 3 is as such:

1.  Our group will be providing insights on the relationships between the business groups. Organizations will have a **better understanding of business relationship patterns.**

2.  From the list of product and services that FishEye has provided, we will develop a process to **identify** **the various business group.**

3.  Our attempt from #2 will not only reveal the **business categories**, but also **measure their similarity and express confidence in the groupings**.

4.  Lastly, we will be shedding lights on the potentially suspicious companies. Here, we attempt to make use of techniques for determining companies who are involved in illegal activity within the network, so that FishEye can further investigate the business groups.

# 4. Approach

The following are the approaches by our team to address the different questions.

## 4.1 Evaluating link inference bundled data sets

Our approach is identifying which bundle is reliable is as follows:

-   Plot a heatmap of the number of transactions over the years to observe the temporal trend and anomalies. The resulting year would be used as the timeframe in the subsequent network graph.

-   Next, plot a treemap based on attributes of the edges, specifically the HSCodes and the Year of the individual trade records. The resulting top HSCode and as well as the anomaly (in this case, the spike in the median weight) will be identified and similarly used for the network graph

-   Another treemap is plotted using the Bundled data based on HSCode Chapter30.

-   Subsequently, a stacked bar chart is plotted to observe which HSCodes are completed to identify which bundles are reliable.

The plotted graphs will then be used to identify new patterns or anomalies that are present when new links are added.
